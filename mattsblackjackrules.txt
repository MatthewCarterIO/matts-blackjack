Blackjack Rules:

- The aim of Blackjack is for the player's hand total to beat that of the dealer's without going above 21.
- One card is dealt face up to the player and then to the dealer.
- A second card is dealt face up to the player and face down to the dealer.
- If the player has a total of 21 with two cards they have "blackjack". The dealer will reveal their hand and unless
they too have blackjack, the player wins.
- When the player does not have blackjack, the dealer offers one or more cards until he/she does not
want another or the total of their hand exceeds 21 and they are "bust". By taking a card the player takes a "hit".
The player "stands" when he/she does not want to take an additional card.
- If the player is bust after receiving one or more cards, the dealer does not need to take any more cards and the
player automatically loses.
- If the player is not bust, the dealer then reveals the hidden card in their hand. As with the player, if they don't
have blackjack there is the opportunity to take one or more additional cards. The dealer will only stand when their
hand total is a minimum of 17.
- Hand totals are compared when all cards have been dealt. The higher hand total (without going above 21) wins. Tied
hands are called a "push".
- Card values are as follows: Numbered cards take their shown value. Picture cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.
Aces can take the value 1 or 11.

Splitting:

- If the player is dealt two cards in the initial hand with the same value, they have the option to split and play them
as two separate hands. To do so the player must match the original bet placed on the newly split hand.
- A second card is dealt to each of the split cards and each hand is played as normal.

Betting:

- The player is given a starting balance of £500.
- The minimum initial bet to play a round is £10.
- All bets should be made in whole pounds (no pence).
- Once the initial hand has been dealt the player has the opportunity to double down. Doubling down enables the player
to double their initial bet but only allows them to take one further card.
- Standard winning hands pay 1:1 (e.g. win £10 for every £10 bet).
- Blackjack pays 3:2 (e.g. win £30 for every £20 bet).
- Upon losing the dealer takes the player's bet.
- No money is collected by the dealer in the event of a push.
